### This is Simple Express Starter Kit

##### Node express + Mongoose ODM ( Mongodb ) + graphql api 

You can use it for your project. If it is useful for you,
don't forget to give me a GitHub star, please.

In this node/express template

   - Express framework
   - NoSQL - Mongodb
   - Mongoose ODM
   - graphql api ( graphql, graphql-http, ruru, graphql-file-loader, resolvers-composition, etc.)
   - JWT auth
   - bcrypt
   - validator 
   - error handler 
   - file uploading 
   - Authorization
   - Pagination etc.

In order to use it,

Create a .env file and add this.  
For Mongodb Atlas

```
MONGO_URL="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.ropxgna.mongodb.net/lucky?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
TOKEN_SECRET="should something hard to read"

```

For Local Mongodb server

```
MONGO_URI="mongodb://127.0.0.1/lucky"
TOKEN_SECRET="should something hard to read"

```
Please note.   
*TOKEN_SECRET* should be complex and hard to guess.  

`File Uploading Process`  

If you use file uploading feature in this kit,  
create nested folders `uploads/images` in the root directory.  
But making directories is up to you. You can configure in `utils/uploadFile.js`.  
My method is to use REST endpoints specifically for file uploads while keeping   
the GraphQL API for other operations. This approach leverages the strengths of   
both REST and GraphQL and can simplify the file upload process.  

That's why, first, you should call REST endpoint for file upload.  
It will give a response with image url link. And then, graphql api can be called  
as usual in order to store that link in the database. Done!  

For large projects, it is the best solution to use aws S3, DigitalOcean space, etc., instead of using file system.  

After git clone, it should be run.

```
npm install
npm start

```   
Warning - every `*.graphql & *.resolver.js` must be inside two nested folders `./**/**/file` .  
It's ok `./graphql/auth/auth.graphql` or `./graphql/product/product.graphql` or something like that.
